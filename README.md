# Installation
Use the install script. There's options to choose which configs to install and whether to backup or clobber existing configs. Uses the XDG Base Directory Specification to determine destination.

# Updating
Since the install script only creates links, there should be no need to re-install as long as those links still exist and no new files have been added. Simply a git repo update should be sufficient then.
